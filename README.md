# IBM Design Test Project
*by Luis Rocha*

Hello IBM Design! In this repository you will find my completed test project. I had a lot of fun completing this page and hope you're pleased with what you see!

I utilized the following in this challenge:

- HTML
- CSS
    - Plain CSS
    - Bulma.io (a lesser known CSS framework based on Flexbox. It's pretty awesome I recommend it!)
- JavaScript
    - jQuery
    - Slidr for a mobile menu 
    - ContentHover for hover animations
    - imagesLoaded to prevent buggy behavior regarding ContentHover classes loading before img elements loaded onto the page 


- Photoshop in order to identify specific color values used

The project is published on github pages and can be seen by visiting: `http://luisrochadev.com/autosales`

Thank you very much for the opportunity and for your consideration. I look forward to hearing back from you!

Happy coding,<br>
Luis Rocha.
